                            I am currently a senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute studying computer science.
                            My primary interests within computer science are distributed systems, particularly theoretical work on algorithms
                            that can also be practically implemented. I hope to work on fault-tolerant systems, byzatine behavior, and using
                            distributed computing to solve novel problems within interdisciplinary fields such as machine learning. I also am passionate about computer graphics
                            and computational geometry, particularly within the context of games and virtual reality. At RPI, I've been a member of the
                            open source development team for <a href="https://submitty.org">Submitty</a>, an open source grading platform, as well as an experienced
                            teaching assistant and tutor for both individual students and review sessions of over 150 students. Additionally, over the last two
                            years I have served as the Vice-President and then President of <a href="https://upe.cs.rpi.edu">Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a>,
                            RPI's computer science honors society. I am the recipient of the RPI Founder's Award of Excellence and the RPI 4.0 Award.

                                        I am currently working with Professor Lirong Xia and Inwon Kang on investigating how we can model
                                        and predict voter perceptions of gerrymandering. We hope to produce a model capable of correctly predicting
                                        how a given district assignment for a population will be perceived as either fair or unfair. Our hope is to
                                        gain insight into how citizens judge their districts and allow fair redistricting efforts to not just ensure 
                                        objective fairness, but also that citizens will trust the assignment as well.

                                        Begun as a project in Professor Lirong Xia's Economics and Computation class, this project investigated
                                        the problem of gerrymandering as a graph problem. Existing definitions of gerrymandering assumed voters
                                        have known, fixed preferences, which does not necessarily reflect the way people vote. How does the
                                        inclusion of probabilistic voter preferences affect the complexity of gerrymandering, and can we make
                                        and efficient algorithm to approximate solutions?

                                        I looked into existing literature and identified the above research question, and worked on both the theoretical
                                        complexity increase caused by considering uncertain voter preferences. I also produced a greedy algorithm
                                        to approximate solutions to the problem, and experimentally showed its success and limitations.

                                        After the class, I worked with Professor Xia to revise the original paper I wrote into a student abstract,
                                        which was submitted to the AAAI-2022 conference.
