                            I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan studying the use of formal methods for verifying distributed protocols
                            with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~manosk/">Dr. Manos Kapritsos</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GLaDOS-Michigan/">GLaDOS@Michigan</a>.
                            Before beginning my Ph.D. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. There, I was a member of the
                            open source development team for <a href="https://submitty.org">Submitty</a>, an open source grading platform, as well as being an experienced
                            teaching assistant and tutor for both individual students and review sessions of over 150 students. At RPI I also
                            served as the Vice-President and President of <a href="https://upe.cs.rpi.edu">Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a>,
                            RPI's computer science honors society. I am the recipient of the RPI Founder's Award of Excellence and the RPI 4.0 Award.

                                        Working with <a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~xial/">Dr. Lirong Xia</a> and Inwon Kang, I investigated how we can model
                                        and predict voter perceptions of gerrymandering. We crowdsourced data on how people perceived gerrymandering by asking them to choose which
                                        of two possible district maps they believed was more fair. Using this data, we determined which features of districts are most important
                                        to people when making their decisions. Additionally, we performed some preliminary work on using machine learning techniques to predict
                                        preceptions for districts.

                                        Begun as a project in Professor Lirong Xia's Economics and Computation class, this project investigated
                                        the problem of gerrymandering as a graph problem. Existing definitions of gerrymandering assumed voters
                                        have known, fixed preferences, which does not necessarily reflect the way people vote. How does the
                                        inclusion of probabilistic voter preferences affect the complexity of gerrymandering, and can we make
                                        and efficient algorithm to approximate solutions?

                                        I looked into existing literature and identified the above research question, and worked on both the theoretical
                                        complexity increase caused by considering uncertain voter preferences. I also produced a greedy algorithm
                                        to approximate solutions to the problem, and experimentally showed its success and limitations.

                                        After the class, I worked with Professor Xia to revise the original paper I wrote into a student abstract,
                                        which was submitted to the AAAI-2022 conference.

                                        semantic web techonologies and their intersection with blockchain technologies. I also was responsible for designing
                                        the SCIENCE ontology that would be the backbone of the system.

                                        Finally, I worked to investigate how we can automatically convert ontologies into smart contracts, capable of fully
